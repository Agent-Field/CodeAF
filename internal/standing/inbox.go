// inbox.go is how news reaches a conversation whose window is not open. It is
// deliberately the simplest thing that works: one JSONL file inside the session
// folder, appended by whoever has news, drained whole the next time the person
// opens that conversation and shown under one "while you were away" fold.
//
// THE DRAIN RENAMES BEFORE IT READS. A note delivered while the fold is being
// built would otherwise be read and then deleted unseen; moving the file aside
// first means a racing delivery starts a fresh inbox that the next open finds.
//
// There are TWO addresses and one shape. A session's inbox is the one below; a
// PROJECT's inbox is the second half of this file, and it exists because not
// every conversation is a screen somebody comes back to — see its own comment.

// ── the project inbox: news for a project, not for one conversation ─────────
//
// A SESSION INBOX IS NOT ALWAYS A SCREEN. The fold above works because a
// session folder is a row on home and a conversation somebody reopens. An
// EXCHANGE — the short errand said at home's `ask here` box — is neither: its
// folder lives under the standing root precisely so home never lists it, and it
// is closed the moment home closes. So a firing whose origin is an exchange and
// whose windows are all shut has nowhere in the session layout to land, and the
// note would sit in a file no screen ever opens.
//
// The project inbox is that address. It belongs to the WORKSPACE rather than to
// a conversation, so home can draw it under the project and the next ordinary
// conversation opened in that project folds it into its own "while you were
// away". One JSONL file, the same [Note] shape and the same append, because the
// only thing that differs is who it is addressed to.

// projectsDirName is where the project inboxes live under the standing root.
// It sits beside exchanges/ and the item documents; nothing that walks the root
// mistakes it for an item, because an item is a `<id>.json` file and a folder
// with a runs/ inside it.
const projectsDirName = "projects"

// ProjectKey is the one name a workspace has under [projectsDirName]: the path
// with its separators turned to dashes, exactly the dumb one-way spelling
// cmd/aforge gives a session bucket under v3/projects, so a person who goes
// looking recognises the folder names from the ones they already know.
//
// IT IS NEVER DECODED AND NEVER JOINED TO A BUCKET. Decoding would be guessing
// which dashes were separators (internal/session's world.go says so about the
// bucket), and nothing here reads a bucket name or hands one out — every caller
// on all three sides holds the workspace path itself, so this is a key and not
// an address anybody has to reverse.
