# Questions aforge asks you

## What a question is here

A question is a choice handed to you with what it is about attached. Every one
of them carries the same things: one sentence saying what is being asked, one
dim line saying why it is being asked now, the answers it will take, what is
waiting on it, and what an answer costs — whether it can be taken back, whether
it costs money or time, or whether it cannot be undone at all.

They are never a box that takes the keyboard away from you. You can go on typing
while one is up, and you can leave one alone; what is waiting on it stays waiting
and says so.

Every one of them is answerable from more than the window it was asked in. The
conversation that raised it can answer it, and so can home, another window on the
same machine, and a window attached over `--host`.

## The kinds of question

Eight shapes, and the shape sets how it is drawn and what a safe answer is.

- **permission** — may this happen. The approval gate before a command runs, an
  offer to connect one of your accounts, an offer to run a saved program. The
  safe answer is to skip it.
- **choice** — which of these. Several answers that have already been thought
  through, usually with one marked as the pick.
- **judgement** — is this good enough. A written page waiting to be approved.
  Only you ever answer one.
- **clarification** — I could not tell what you meant. Words are the first
  answer to this one, not the last.
- **confirmation** — this is about to happen and it cannot be taken back. Never
  on a clock, and the answer that changes nothing is the one under the cursor.
- **landing** — work that finished and that nobody could check. It is the `your
  call` row on a task.
- **assumption** — what is being taken for granted. Everything on it stands
  unless you strike one.
- **ratify** — something reversible was already done, and this is your chance to
  unwind it. Nothing is waiting on the answer.

## Which questions wait, and which one carries a clock

Most of them wait. A wait that ended is not a no: an approval question, a
standing card and a page waiting to be approved carry no clock at all, and they
stay up until somebody answers them.

**A task proposal is the one with a clock.** The card says how long is left, and
when the time runs out the work STARTS — the card is your chance to redirect it,
not a gate the work waits on. A proposal you hold loses its deadline and then
waits like everything else.

**Nothing that cannot be taken back ever runs on a clock**, and only you ever answer
one. aforge refuses to raise a question that says otherwise.

## The record — where your answers are saved

Every answer you give is written down, in the conversation's own folder, in a
file called `decisions.jsonl`. One line each: what was asked, what you
picked, anything you said beside your pick, who decided, when, and whether it can
still be changed.

The record is read BEFORE anything is asked. A question you have already answered
about the same thing is refused with `already decided:` and what you decided, so
you are not asked the same thing twice.

An answer that was not yours — a proposal whose clock ran out, an answer a
setting gave — is written down as exactly that, rather than as something you
said.

## A finished task waiting on your word counts as needing you

Work that finished and that nobody could check sits on `your call`. That is a
question like any other: home says the conversation is waiting on you, the tab
signal lights, and the switcher marks the row — the same as it does for an
approval or a standing card.

It did not always. A task on `your call` used to leave every one of those saying
the conversation was idle, and the only way to find it was to open the
conversation and look.

## Answering a question from somewhere else

Home lists what a conversation is waiting on and lets you answer it there. So
does another window on the same machine, and a window attached to this machine
over `--host`.

The keys are the ones the question wrote down and nothing else — a window never
offers an answer the conversation would drop. **The first answer wins.** If two
windows answer the same question, the second is simply late, and nothing is said
about it.

## Questions aforge refuses to put to you

Before a question reaches you it has to be a real one, and aforge refuses it
otherwise:

- a question with no sentence saying what is being asked
- a question with no reason for asking now
- a question that does not say what an answer costs
- fewer than two answers, on a kind that needs a list
- more than four answers — eight where you are ticking several — because a fifth
  is almost always two questions that have not been separated
- a pick that names an answer not on the list
- a clock, or any setting that answers in your place, on something that cannot
  be taken back
- more than three questions standing open about ONE piece of work; past that they
  have to be put together into one

The refusal always says what to do instead: choose, or say what is being assumed.

## What is not built yet

There is no page you can open a question out into, no count of open questions in
the status line, and no setting that answers a whole kind of question for you
from now on. Those are designed and not built; if the chat offers you one, it is
improvising.
