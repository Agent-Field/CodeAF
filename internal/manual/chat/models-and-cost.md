# Models, context, and what it costs

## Which model am I talking to, and how do I switch it

The model in use is written in the status line. There are two doors to the picker:

- type `/model` with nothing after it, or
- press the model's name in the status line.

If you have turned the mouse off (`ui.mouse`), only the command works. Inside a task room
the name in the status line is inert — the picker moves the conversation's model, not the
node's.

The picker is a filter box in the input line's place with a short list of models under it.
It is bottom-anchored: the conversation shrinks above it, so nothing pops up over what you
were reading.

Choosing a model does three things: the model is set on the session, the surface learns
that model's context window and tells the session (compaction fires at a fraction of the
window, so this is not decoration), and a note appears reading `model · <model>`.

esc leaves the picker and changes **nothing** — your half-typed draft, the model in use and
the frame all come back exactly as they were. The picker holds its own filter text, and the
filter is forgotten when it closes.

## Moving and filtering in the model picker

Type to filter. The keys:

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| ↑ / ctrl+p, ↓ / ctrl+n | move a row |
| pgup / pgdown | move 12 rows |
| left, right, home, end, ctrl+u, ctrl+w | edit the filter text |
| ctrl+t | walk the reasoning effort of the model under the cursor |
| enter | switch to the row under the cursor |
| esc | cancel, changing nothing |

The cursor opens **on the model in use**, which is also the marked row, so enter with
nothing typed confirms rather than changes.

Filtering splits what you type on whitespace; every token must match, each in one of three
tiers — prefix, then substring, then subsequence. So `ds v4` finds
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` and `claude 4.5` finds `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, and fuzzy
hits sit at the bottom rather than mixed through. Twelve rows show at a time.

The picker **never fetches**. The list comes from what is already known, in this order: the
catalog the door passed in, then `~/.aforge/v3/models.json`, then five names this build
remembers (`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`,
`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, `google/gemini-2.5-flash`, `moonshotai/kimi-k3`). Each rung is
tried only when the one above it came back empty after filtering.

The placeholder in the empty filter box is the only place the overlay explains itself:
`filter · ↑↓ · ctrl+t effort · enter switch · esc cancel`

There is no mouse commit on the picker's rows.

## What each row in the model picker tells you

A row reads `<id>:<level>` on the left and, dimly on the right, the facts the catalog
published: the context window, the price per million prompt and completion tokens, and the
arena elo. **Each part is hidden when nobody published it.** A price shows only when both
halves are known — a zero means "nobody said", never "free".

Only models you can hold a conversation with are listed: text in, text out. A model that
publishes `["image","text"]` out (a drawing model that captions) is excluded, and so is a
transcription model (audio in, text out). A row that publishes nothing about itself is judged
by its id against a narrow list of generation and sidecar words.

## Switching model by name in one command

`/model <slug>` switches straight to that slug — no list, no confirmation.

It takes the slug at its word: there is no check that the slug exists in any known list. If
the slug is not in any list aforge knows, the context window is left alone.

## Reasoning effort

Reasoning effort is set in the model picker with **ctrl+t**, on the model under the cursor.
Each press walks it round: off → low → medium → high → off.

- On a model whose catalog row does not accept a reasoning knob, ctrl+t does **nothing at
  all, silently** — the level would be a 400 at the next turn. A row that published nothing
  counts as "does not accept", so the knob is missing rather than offered wrongly.
- The level lives on the session, **per model id**. It survives switching away to another
  model and back. `/new` forgets it.
- Where the level is set, it is shown after the id as `<id>:<level>` — in the picker row, and
  on the `model` line of `/status`.

## What this conversation has cost — /cost

`/cost` (also `/usage`, `/tokens`, `/spend`) prints what this conversation has spent, and on
what, into the conversation. Up to five aligned lines:

| Line | What it is |
|---|---|
| `spend` | the money, printed only when it is above zero |
| `tokens` | `48.1k in · 3.2k out`, or one half alone, or the combined figure |
| `cache` | `31.2k read · saved $0.0180` — the money half only when a price pair was published |
| `model calls` | **requests to the provider**, deliberately not "turns" |
| `time` | how long |

`model calls` is the line people misread. One thing you type can become several requests to
the provider — every step of a turn is its own request — so this figure is normally larger
than the number of times you have spoken.

**Every line is dropped when its figure is absent.** A provider that publishes no cache
accounting says nothing about caches, rather than teaching you that your cache never hits.

It will not go silent. A session with no figures at all answers exactly:

```
nothing spent yet — this session has not sent a turn.
```

## Everything at once — /status

`/status` (also `/info`, `/context`) prints **every fact the status line can carry**, one per
line, into the conversation. It is not a panel. Usage totals are refreshed first, so a
command typed between turns answers from what the session holds now.

The labels come in this order, each dropped when its value is empty: `session`, `task` (only
inside a task room), `model` (the full routing address, with `:level` when a reasoning level
is set), `task model` (only in a room), `served`, then the telemetry segments under their own
words — `background`, `changes`, `spend`, `context`, `cache`, `rate`, `compaction`,
`approvals`, `state` — then `tasks`, `place`, `keys`, and finally `file`. Labels are padded
into two aligned columns.

Two things differ deliberately from the status line on screen:

- the session **file** is added, because a path is a thing you copy into another program;
- the `spend` line is **dropped** when nothing has been spent. The live status line keeps
  `$0.00`; a note printed into the conversation must not.

Over `--host`, the `place` and `file` values are written in full as `machine:/path`.

## How much room the conversation has

The context window is, most specific first: the one the surface set for the model actually in
use, then the window the session was configured with, then a conservative default of
**128,000 tokens** (the smallest window among the models this surface routes to).

Compaction is triggered at **`window − max(15% of window, 16384)`**, with that reserve
clamped to at most half the window. When a pass runs, the **verbatim tail** it keeps is
**20,000 tokens**, capped at a quarter of the window.

The current size is the larger of two figures: the context size the provider last reported,
and an estimate of the transcript at 4 bytes per token. That way a 300KB tool result appended
since the last response is already visible to the threshold.

An unknown window has no threshold at all.

**Accuracy note.** aforge also carries a shared context-budget package with a 60%-fill rule,
a 160k working set and a 250% reuse law. **That package is not used by this chat.** Its
consumer is the sub-harness leaf sizing elsewhere in aforge. The chat's own law is the one
above — do not describe this conversation as filling to 60%.

## What happens before the conversation is summarized

aforge does not jump straight to summarizing. There are rungs before it.

**Rung 1 — stubbing.** At the end of every completed turn, tool results older than the last
**4 turns** and larger than **1500 bytes** are replaced *in the live context* by a pointer
line:

```
[output stubbed — 214332 bytes · full output: .aforge-v3/stubs/<hash>.txt]
```

The bytes are written to disk first, named by their own digest, and the model can `read` them
back at any time. **The journal is never stubbed** — the record on disk keeps the whole
result. An interrupted or failed turn is left alone, and a session with no workspace does
nothing here.

**Rung 2 — page images.** Instead of summarizing the part being dropped, it can be
photographed: rendered verbatim to monospaced page images that the model reads back. No model
call, nothing paraphrased. This rung is chosen only when you gave `/compact` no focus, there
is a workspace, there is page budget, and the model in use can read images. Pages are 120
columns by 64 lines, greyscale, deterministic, footed `<title> | context page 1 of 4`, and
saved under `<workspace>/.aforge-v3/frames/`. The ceiling is **8 pages**; anything past it is
summarized and appended after the pages.

**Rung 3 — the summary.** One call on the session's own model, with no tools, that must
produce six sections — `## Goal`, `## Constraints & Preferences`, `## Progress`,
`## Key Decisions`, `## Next Steps`, `## Critical Context` — and must reproduce any
unanswered question verbatim and preserve exact paths, symbols, commands and error text.

## What a compaction pass keeps

The transcript is cut at a message boundary, walking back from the tail until the keep-recent
budget is spent. The system message is never cut.

What is rebuilt, in order: the system message, then the page images if there are any, then
the summary note if there is one, then **the state block verbatim**, then the kept tail. The
state block — what `track` and `commit` recorded — is injected directly and is **never routed
through the summarizer**, so working state cannot be paraphrased away.

The note the model reads above a summary begins:

```
[context compacted] Everything before this point was summarized to fit the context window. This note is the record of that conversation — it is not something either of us said, and any question inside it is still open.
```

A pass can decline: `session: nothing to compact` (everything already fits in the tail),
`session: a compaction pass is already running`, or `session: summarizer returned nothing`.

## When compaction happens by itself

Three ways a pass starts:

- **Automatically**, after any step where the estimate is over the threshold. A failed pass is
  not a failed turn.
- **On a context-overflow error from the provider**, once per turn. This one runs **even when
  automatic compaction is switched off** — the switch governs the automatic pass, not the
  recovery from a request the provider has already refused. Overflow errors are never retried.
- **On demand**, when you ask for it.

While a pass runs you see `compacting ~84k tokens` (`~842` under a thousand). On success:
`compacted from ~84k tokens, kept last ~20k`, or with page images
`compacted from ~84k tokens to 4 page images, kept last ~20k`. On failure:
`compaction failed · context unchanged`. A failed pass always settles its row.

## /compact — compacting now

`/compact` summarizes the conversation on demand. It notes `compacting…` immediately and runs
the pass off the loop, so the surface stays alive.

**Success is silent.** There is no "done" message — a compaction that worked simply leaves the
conversation shorter. A failure comes back as `compact failed: ` followed by the error.

A `/compact` given a focus always goes to the summary rung rather than page images, because a
renderer cannot be careful about anything. The focus is *appended* to the summarizer's
instructions and never replaces them, so one careless phrase cannot cost the next session its
file paths. It travels on that one request and no further.

## Turning automatic compaction off

Launch with `aforge chat --no-compact` or `aforge resume --no-compact`. The flag's own help
text reads `never compact automatically`.

What it turns off is exactly the automatic threshold check. Still working:

- `/compact`, when you ask for it, and
- the recovery pass when the provider itself refuses a request as too long.

With a `--host` remote launch the flag is **refused rather than ignored**, because it cannot
travel to the other machine.

## Spending limits

A session can carry a spend ceiling. When it is set, a turn is stopped **before it starts**,
reading the session's own recorded usage — so a turn already in flight is never cut in half.
The refusal arrives as an error carrying the sentence:

```
session: the spend rail was reached
```

A ceiling of zero means there is none.

The settings panel's **Session** tab carries a row for it, labelled `session ceiling`. The
panel's search matches a row's registry key as well as its label, so typing either `spendRail`
or `ceiling` finds it.
