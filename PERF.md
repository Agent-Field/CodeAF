# Measuring performance

## Measure the changed path

Use focused tests and benchmarks while editing. Record the Go version, operating
system, architecture, benchmark command and relevant fixture size so results can
be reproduced. Compare the same workload before and after the change.

```sh
make test-focus PKGS=./internal/pkg RUN='^TestRegression$$'
go test ./internal/pkg -run '^$' -bench BenchmarkName -benchmem -count=5
make test-report PKGS=./internal/pkg REPORT=/tmp/codeaf-tests.json
```

Replace the package and test names with the path being measured. Benchmark timing
is diagnostic; regression gates count deterministic work, bytes, allocations,
request fanout, retained data and cache reuse. Do not gate on wall-clock thresholds.
Use scripted providers and explicit synchronization rather than real sleeps.

## What the gates check

`make test-quick` checks compilation, vet, formatting, packed manuals, change
entries, manual coverage and structural laws. `make pr-ready` adds fresh tests
for packages selected from the committed diff. CI uses the same touched-package
selector. Heavy suites share a per-machine lock; do not stack full chat or engine
runs during an editing loop. Use `SHARDS=1` when a serial reproduction is needed.

Performance tests beside the implementation pin bounds on prompt and response
sizes, allocations, decompression, request counts, retained previews and rendering
work. Preserve those assertions when changing a hot path. Paint must not perform
filesystem or network reads. Document any cap change with its rationale in the
same commit; derive repeated values from constants.

## Binary size

`SIZE-BUDGET` is the stripped binary's byte cap. `make size` builds through
`make build`, weighs `bin/codeaf` and fails above that cap. `make check` includes
this gate; `make build` alone does not impose it. CI's size report is informational.

Compare builds with the same Go version, target, flags and embedded engine
artifact. The reference target is darwin/amd64 with its own pinned artifact staged;
other platforms can have different absolute sizes. Reduce unnecessary code, data
or dependencies first. A justified cap adjustment belongs in the same change as
the feature and its measurements; keep `SIZE-BUDGET` explicit and reviewable.
